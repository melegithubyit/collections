        THE YALE SCHOOL OF ART IS A GRADUATE SCHOOL THAT CONFERS MASTER OF FINE
        ARTS DEGREES IN GRAPHIC DESIGN, PAINTING/PRINTMAKING, PHOTOGRAPHY, AND
        SCULPTURE
      </h5>
      <br />
      <p>
        Artists and designers of unusual promise and strong motivation are
        provided an educational context in which they can explore the potential
        of their own talents in the midst of an intense critical dialogue. This
        dialogue is generated by their peers, by distinguished visitors, and by
        a faculty comprised of professional artists of acknowledged
        accomplishment.
        <br />
        The graduate student’s primary educational experience at Yale is
        centered on the student’s own studio activity. Supporting this
        enterprise are the experience, knowledge, and skills gained from
        rigorous, structured courses such as drawing, filmmaking, the relativity
        of color, and the rich academic offerings found throughout Yale. Each
        student is routinely exposed to many aesthetic positions through
        encounters with faculty members and visitors. The School is devoted not
        only to the refinement of visual skills, but also to the cultivation of
        the mind. Students must bring creative force and imagination to their
        own development, for these qualities cannot be taught—they can only be
        stimulated and appreciated.
        <br />
        The School of Art offers an undergraduate art major for students in Yale
        College (see the bulletin Yale College Programs of Study). In addition,
        the School’s courses are open to students in the Graduate School of Arts
        and Sciences and other professional schools of the University, and
        School of Art students may enroll in elective courses in the Graduate
        School and other professional schools as well as in the College with
        permission.

      <h5>MASTER OF FINE ARTS DEGREE (MFAS)</h5>
      <p>
        The degree of Master of Fine Arts is the only degree offered by the
        School of Art. It is conferred by the University upon recommendation of
        the faculty after successful completion of all course work in residence
        and after a thesis presentation that has been approved by the faculty.
        It implies distinctive achievement on the part of students in studies in
        the professional area of their choice and demonstrated capacity for
        independent work. The minimum residence requirement is two years. <br />
        All candidates’ work is reviewed by faculty at the end of each term. If
        the work is not considered satisfactory, the student may not be invited
        back to complete the program (see section on Review and Awards under
        Academic Regulations in the chapter General Information). All degree
        candidates are expected to be present at the Commencement exercises in
        May unless excused by the dean. Course work for the Master of Fine Arts
        degree carries a minimum of sixty credits. The disposition of these
        credits varies according to the area of study and is agreed upon at the
        time of registration between the student and the student’s faculty
        adviser.

      <h5>PUBLIC LECTURES AND EXHIBITIONS</h5>
      <p>
        Each department has its own visitors program in which professionals from
        outside the School are invited to lecture to students or take part in
        critiques.
        <br />
        The School also facilitates a public all-school lecture program, in
        which ideas of general and cross-disciplinary importance are explored by
        visiting artists and members of the faculty in events typically hosted
        in the evening that are free and open to the public.
        <br />
        The School of Art’s galleries in Green Hall and EIK at 32 Edgewood
        Avenue provide a year-round forum for the exhibition of work by
        students, faculty, and special guests in the four graduate departments
        of the School and the undergraduate program. Green Gallery is open to
        the public when exhibitions are scheduled, but open hours vary by
        semester. EIK is open during limited hours for specific exhibitions and
        events. Please refer to the Gallery & Publications page for more
        information.
