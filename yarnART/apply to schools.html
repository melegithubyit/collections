          <p>
            Admission of Students are admitted to Yale’s MFA for the Fall
            semester of each year only. Applicants are notified of the admission
            committee’s decisions on preliminary selections in February, and
            final decisions in early March. No information about decisions will
            be given over the phone or advance of the batch written release to
            all finalists. To apply for more than one area of concentration,
            separate applications and supporting documentation must be
            submitted. The work submitted should be representative of the
            applicant’s experience in that particular field. Applying to more
            than one program does not increase an applicant’s chances of
            selection. Please note: Yale School of Art does not practice
            admission deferment; An offer of admission is valid only for
            enrollment for that year regardless of the in-residence conditions
            of the Yale campus at that time. Applicants who are offered
            admission but choose not to enroll are welcome to reapply to the
            School in a future cycle. APPLICATION DEADLINE: Online applications
            for programs beginning in the 2023–2024 academic year will open
            October of 2022 with a due date of early January 2023. Please expect
            that when many applicants are uploading simultaneously near the
            deadline, lengthier processing times will be experienced. To avoid
            this, please consider submitting prior to the deadline day.
            Admission Procedures for Preliminary Selection Instructions for All
            Applicants An application to the School of Art requires forethought
            and planning. It is important to read all of the application
            instructions carefully. Following these instructions will ensure
            that your application is viewed to best advantage. The Yale School
            of Art application for the 2023–2024 academic year will be available
            October 2022. The information that follows will assist you in filing
            the application online. For an explanation of specific requirements
            for each area of study, please refer to the departmental sections
            that follow.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Application materials:</h2>
          <p>
            The following materials are required for consideration of your
            application for admission: Submit the online application.
            Application portal opens early October 2022 and may be worked until
            the early January 2023. As it generally takes several weeks to
            complete an application, it is strongly recommended that applicants
            prepare their materials early to ensure completion by the deadline.
            Please note that the School of Art is NOT part of the Yale Graduate
            School of Arts and Sciences, and it is not possible to apply by
            using application materials found on the Graduate School’s Web site.
            Nonrefundable application fee of $100. Please follow payment
            instructions at https://apply.art.yale.edu/apply/. Forms of payment
            include credit card and checking account. <br />
            Yale School of Art practices “need blind admission”; meaning that,
            candidate financial need or ability is never disclosed to the
            admission committee during review of MFA applications. For this
            reason, and because the processing and careful review of each
            individual application demands great time and human resources
            graduate fee waivers are not available. Beginning in January 2022,
            Fee may be waived only for applicants with primary citizenship in
            the following nations only, those with the lowest US exchange rates
            Venezuela, Iran, Vietnam, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Sierra Leone, Laos,
            Guinea, Paraguay, Cambodia A one-page statement that addresses
            influences, interests, current work direction, brief life history
            (as it relates to art/design practice), and reasons for applying to
            graduate school at this time. Statements should be limited to one
            page or no more than 500 words. Applicants to the
            Painting/Printmaking program should make reference in their
            statements to the “representative work” in the portfolio; this is
            not critical for the other programs. <br />

            References from three persons, either practicing/teaching in the
            field in which application is made, or who knows the applicant’s
            practice well and can attest to their ability, competency,
            potential, etc. in Yale’s MFA program. NOTE: The admissions
            committee reviews applications shortly after the deadline. While it
            is not uncommon for letters of recommendation to come in past the
            deadline, please impress upon on those who will be writing on your
            behalf that late submission of supporting documentation may risk
            exclusion from the review. Applicants can always view the receipt
            status of reference requests on the application status page.
            Transcripts of academic record for the bachelor’s degree and/or
            professional art schools attended. <br />
            Student/unofficial copies may be uploaded to the application for the
            preliminary jury. Official transcripts will ONLY be required for
            applicants invited to interview. If invited to interview, official
            transcripts should be mailed to: Yale School of Art Admissions, POB
            208339, New Haven, CT 06520-8339. Neither junior college transcripts
            nor Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are required. Portfolio
            of work. Applicants who fail to upload a portfolio as outlined by
            the stated deadline will NOT be considered. The portfolio should
            represent images of your best work, indicate your current direction,
            and demonstrate your ability. <br />
            At least half of the images should represent work done within the
            last twelve months, and all should be from within the last three
            years. Chronological order of year is embedded in our system, and
            you will not be able to override it. The application system used by
            Yale requires that one image from the portfolio be designated as a
            “representative work.” This selection is simply the default image
            for the cover page of each application file. As such, applicants
            have historically selected the piece which most strongly represents
            ideas central to their current body of work. <br />

            Do not include more than one image on the screen, nor embed other
            pages of a publication or video within the images you place in your
            portfolio. Do not include detail photos of work in your portfolio
            unless you consider them absolutely necessary. Under no
            circumstances should more than two detail shots be included.
            Portfolio requirements differ depending upon area of concentration;
            be sure to follow the instructions for the area to which you are
            applying. We strongly recommend that you review your images on a Mac
            OS to be certain that they are accurately represented. NOTE: All
            supporting documents that are submitted as a requirement for
            admission become a part of the official file and cannot be returned
            to the applicant or forwarded to another institution either in copy
            or original form.

            We do not practice deferred admission. The Financial Aid Award
            letter will be e-mailed shortly after notification of admission. No
            decisions will be given in person or over the telephone. An
            individual’s acceptance of admission to the School of Art must be
            received by April 1. All matriculating students must submit a
            transcript that certifies their undergraduate degree. Admission is
            not binding unless this certification is received.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS</h2>
          <p>
            The School of Art requires for admission a high degree of capability
            and commitment. Applicants must hold a bachelor’s degree from an
            accredited college or university or a diploma from a four-year
            accredited professional art school. In exceptional cases and most
            particularly in light of the differences among educational
            structures and opportunities in the international art world today,
            the admissions committee may waive these prerequisites if other
            proofs of preparation and accomplishment are deemed sufficient
            equivalents by the committee. In either case, admission to the
            School of Art is on a highly selective and competitive basis.

          <br /><br />YALE UNIVERSITY’S NONDISCRIMINATION/TITLE IX STATEMENTS<br />
          <p>
            The University is committed to basing judgments concerning the
            admission, education, and employment of individuals upon their
            qualifications and abilities and affirmatively seeks to attract to
            its faculty, staff, and student body qualified persons of diverse
            backgrounds. In accordance with this policy and as delineated by
            federal and Connecticut law, Yale does not discriminate in
            admissions, educational programs, or employment against any
            individual on account of that individual’s sex, race, color,
            religion, age, disability, status as a protected veteran, or
            national or ethnic origin; nor does Yale discriminate on the basis
            of sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. University
            policy is committed to affirmative action under law in employment of
            women, minority group members, individuals with disabilities, and
            protected veterans. Inquiries concerning these policies may be
            referred to Valarie Stanley, Director of the Office for Equal
            Opportunity Programs, 221 Whitney Avenue, 3rd Floor, 203.432.0849.
            For additional information, see www.yale.edu/equalopportunity. Title
            IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects people from sex
            discrimination in educational programs and activities at
            institutions that receive federal financial assistance. Questions
            regarding Title IX may be referred to the University’s Title IX

        <h1>FINANCIAL AID & STUDENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES</h1>
        <p>
          <br />
          The undergraduate admissions process is handled entirely through Yale
          College. Please refer all undergraduate admissions questions to the
          Yale College Undergraduate Admissions Office.

        <p>
          The Financial Aid process for the Yale School of Art’s graduate MFA
          program functions cyclically with each academic year. Students are
          responsible for submitting different Financial Aid-related information
          depending on where they are in the Financial Aid process. Find the
          details and timeline pertaining to your Financial Aid application by

        <h1>COURSE DESCRIPTIONS</h1>
        <p>
          <br />
          In the following listings, courses numbered 110 through 499 are studio
          electives offered to students from Yale College and the graduate and
          professional schools. Permission of the instructor is required for
          enrollment in all courses. Graduate students of the School of Art who
          wish to broaden their experience outside their area of concentration
          have priority in enrollment. Courses numbered 500 and above are
          offered only to graduate students of the School of Art. In exceptional
          cases qualified Yale College students may enroll in a graduate course,
          with the permission of both the instructor and the director of
          undergraduate studies. Please refer to the section on Academic
          Regulations for further pertinent details. It should be noted that, as
          a matter of policy, all faculty members teach on both the graduate and
          undergraduate levels, although the degree and the nature of contact
          may vary. Tutorials, which are special courses that cannot be obtained
          through regular class content, require a proposal written by the
          student and the faculty member concerned, defining both content and
          requirements. Proposals must be presented to the Academic Subcommittee
          for approval.

        <h1>HOUSING GUIDANCE</h1>
        <p>
          <br />
          OFF CAMPUS HOUSING RESOURCES Yale is home to 6,500 Graduate and
          Professional School students, many of whom prefer to live off campus.
          The University offers limited on-campus housing options for graduate
          and PhD students, so the Yale Housing Office maintains a portal with
          Off-Campus Listings in which the property owners are verified.<br />
          We recommend starting there, or with listings that will be updated on
          this page from within the School of Art community, or on the closed
          Facebook Group. As you look for apartments Yale recommends trying to
          stay within the Yale Shuttle routes to benefit from this service as
          well as campus safety resources such as the LiveSafe app, but this is
          of course up to you.<br />

          Additionally, students leaving the program will soon have apartments
          that they are vacating, and we will begin posting those opportunities
          here; there are some property owners in the vicinity who have
          routinely rented to School of Art and Architecture students and those
          individuals can be easy to work with.<br />
          When using outside listing resources such as Facebook or Craigslist,
          be mindful of course of scams and bad actors. Anyone presenting
          themselves as a Yale student, staff or faculty should be able to
          verify their identity with a university email address that ends either
          in yale.edu orbulldogs.yale.edu; NEVER @yale.com. Do not send
          passwords, verification codes or money to anyone without verifying
          their identity or signing a vetted lease.<br />
